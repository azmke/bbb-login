- BigBlueButton pages are automatically recognized and the entered access code and last participant name are saved so that no manual addition is necessary.
- When a saved room is called up, the access code and the last user name are automatically filled in. All you have to do is start!
- Saved rooms can be accessed and deleted directly from a list in the extension's pop-up window.
- Saved rooms are synchronized in all Chrome browsers in which you are logged in and have installed the extension.
